# CISD022B Middle Level C++ Course Workspace

This is my personal workspace for the CISD022B Middle Level C++ Course. 
This repository serves as a hub for my notes, homework, projects, and any additional resources I find helpful throughout the course.

## Introduction

As a student enrolled in the CISD022B course, my goal is to deepen my understanding of C++ and advance my programming skills. 
This includes mastering object-oriented programming, exploring data structures and algorithms, and becoming proficient in the more complex aspects of C++.

## Course Overview

The CISD022B course focuses on several key areas, including but not limited to:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Advanced Data Structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
- Algorithms
- Memory Management
- Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL)

## Repository Structure

- `/Notes`: Contains my course notes, organized by week.
- `/Homework`: My solutions to the weekly homework assignments.
- `/Practice`: Practice project files and my practice projects.
- `/Resources`: Additional resources I've compiled, including tutorials, useful links, and reference materials.

## Progress

Here, I'll track my progress through the course, noting any particular challenges I've faced and how I've addressed them.

- [x] Week 1: Class basic
- [x] Week 2: Deep Dive into Class
- [x] Week 3: inheritance and polymorphism.
- [ ] Week 3: More deep into inheritance and polymorphism.

## Reflections

Periodic reflections on what I've learned, difficulties encountered, and how my understanding of programming is evolving.
